MAKE
Install make from cygwin only
GNU Make is used to make installation of software abstract.
makefile in the software distribution includes shell commands and compile commands etc to build dependencies which all in effect installs the software.
GNU Make is the software that can read and execute makefile instructions.


PERL
Perl was downloaded from www.activestate.com
shell commmand : perl -v to check installation
shell command : cpan (installed ansi and mingw 4.3.2 and dmake.... whatever)
shell command : cpan -i Text::Template (installed the perl module text template, for installing openssl)

Before attempting anything, google for shortcuts at least five times!!!

Openssl
Finally installed openssl using cygwin64.

Cygwin
To install new packages, reinstall cygwin with setup.
When selecting packages to install, select only bin as it is the final executable. src is the source code.
For openssl, select openssl under net
For cpp and make, select under devel : gcc-g++ , gdb , make
